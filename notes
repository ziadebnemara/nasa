0 - FALSE POSITIVE
1 - CONFIRMED
2 - CANDIDATE



know the following:
- explain what we are solving
- know the physics:
    how we identify exoplanets
    importance of the included factors like: transit depth, stellar radius, snr, ...
- explain why you chose the current fields and not others
- why we chose XGBoosting model
- explain accuracy, percision, recall, confusion matrix, ROC, feature importance
- presenting:
    while presenting to judges you could include light curve example
    feature importance:
        duration: determining if orbital period is physically possible
        magnitude: dim stars more noise
        period: false positives usually have wierd orbits
        snr: still important but the model finds the upper ones more useful
        depth: it isn't good alone, what if there are binary stars
- importance :
    can help filter out candidates or planets from many false positives
    use ai to reduce telescopes time, which are expensive and limited. this could help prioritize planets to follow up with telescopes like JWST
- future work:
    our work is not finished
    we could use raw light curves and cnn to make even more accurate estimations
    improve snr
    add more missions





story telling:
– The Problem: “Finding planets in noisy data is hard. Many false positives waste telescope time.”
– Our Approach: “We built an AI using Kepler & TESS data, trained with astrophysical features (depth, radius, SNR, etc.).”
– Results: Show accuracy, confusion matrix, feature importance.
– Why It Matters: connect to NASA’s goals .
– Future Work: how to improve and scale.
